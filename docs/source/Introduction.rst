Introduction
============

CSC-ISAC Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform is one of grant project from ISIF Foundation. The goal of the project is to consume information gathers from independent sensors (ex. Honeypots, IDS, Endpoint Detection) 
to have a centralized database and has independent analysis team to be able to share with the cyber security community inside South East Asia Region. 
Our baseline Threat Intelligence Platform based on several open source project such as: 

1. Honeypot
2. MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)
3. NodeRed

We Integrate those open source project to cooexist and collaborate together to perform analysis and sharing platform for our community.

Threat Intelligence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Threat intelligence is knowledge that allows you to prevent or mitigate cyberattacks. Rooted in data, threat intelligence gives you context that helps you make informed decisions about your security by answering questions like who is attacking you, what their motivations and capabilities are, and what indicators of compromise in your systems to look for.

What is Honeypot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A machine that attracts "Attacker". It was made as weak and as interesting as the creator can be to attract the "Attacker" so that the "Attacker" will be interested and injecting something to the honeypot like it was the real machine.

Deployment Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our Architectures considering a scalable environment that can be integrated with various organizations and even researchers that want to contribute with our CSC-ISAC Community. 
The architecture is presented as follows:
